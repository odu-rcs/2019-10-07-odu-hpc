The Research Computing Group at ODU is pleased to launch our second hands-on introduction to our HPC facility in October! This short workshop is suitable to those who are new to the Turing and Wahab clusters or would like to gain more exposure to using the UNIX shell.

Spend an afternoon with ODU's Research Computing Services team as we introduce basic skills for HPC! No prior computational experience is required. This workshop is intended to present a basic introduction to HPC (with particular emphasis on ODUâ€™s Wahab cluster), job schedulers, and the UNIX shell. It will also provide an overview of the tools available on Wahab and how to use them effectively. We will use a hands-on format to teach fundamental skills for working effectively on HPC clusters. Make sure you bring a laptop.
